# Solution explanation

The provided solution is a basic React functional component named App. Within this component, the return statement specifies the content to be rendered on the screen.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

## Component Definition

```js
function App() {
    return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}
```

The App function is a simple functional component in React.

It doesn't need any props or parameters.

Within the component body, there's a single return statement that returns an `<h1>` element containing the text "Hello World!".

## Export
```js
export default App;
```

The `export default App;` line exports the App component as the default export. This enables other parts of the application to import and use this component.

When `App` component is integrated into a React application and rendered, this component will show this text in the rendered output.
